# JavaDocs Simplfier

This is a simple website that simplifies (specifically enum JavaDoc pages) for end-user consumptions.

You can access the website directly [here](https://cryptomorin.github.io/Javadocs-Simplifier).

# API

To use the API, you can use the following format:

```hs
https://cryptomorin.github.io/Javadocs-Simplifier/api/v1?url=...
```

E.g.

```hs
https://cryptomorin.github.io/Javadocs-Simplifier/api/v1?url=https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/inventory/meta/trim/TrimPattern.html
```

The page might not work in presense of custom JavaDocs generated pages (which is rare.)
